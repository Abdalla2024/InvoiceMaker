            <p>
              Invoice Maker is an iOS application that allows users to create, manage, and share
              professional invoices entirely on-device. The app provides tools for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating professional invoices with customizable templates</li>
              <li>Managing client information and invoice history</li>
              <li>Generating PDF invoices for sharing and printing</li>
              <li>Calculating totals, taxes, and other invoice components</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          
          <section className="privacy-section">
            <h2>Accounts and Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
              The app does not require an account and does not use developer-operated servers. Invoices
              are stored locally on your device using Apple technologies (SwiftData) and limited
              preferences via <code>UserDefaults</code> (for example, invoice numbering and company info reuse).
              Generated PDFs are created on-device and shared only when you choose to export or share them.
